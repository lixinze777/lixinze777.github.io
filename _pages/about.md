<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a a second-year Ph.D. student in College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I am co-advised by Prof. [Aixin Sun](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/axsun/) and Prof. [Yixin Cao](https://sites.google.com/view/yixin-homepage). Before that, I received my Bachelor of Computing Degree (with Honours) from National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2021, and worked as a project officer in S-lab, NTU until 2023.

My research interest includes retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and long document understanding. I have published papers at top international conferences ACL and NeurIPS with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XdNw0cwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>200+</span></strong></a>.
